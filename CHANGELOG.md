## 10.6.13

Release date: 2025-10-27, commit hash: 155356259a4a7ebc63a0b86ad44474a22b72e05e

### Changed
- Renamed `ChannelReadMode` to `WebSocketChannelReadMode`
- Removed `IChannelWithReadMode`, updated `WebSocketChannel` to implement `IAsyncEnumerable` directly.

### Infrastructure
- Added `UnbufferedPushSequence<T>` for unbuffered async data streaming
- Added `[UnsafeAccessor]`-based helpers for `AsyncTaskMethodBuilder<T>` in `AsyncTaskMethodBuilderExt`.

### Documentation
- Replaced `.instructions.md` with updated `AGENTS.md` and `CODING_STYLE.md`

## 10.6.4

Release date: 2025-10-25

### Breaking Changes
- **Breaking**: Removed `FusionDefaults` and `FusionMode` types.
  Use `RuntimeInfo.IsServer`, `ComputedRegistry.Settings`, and `Timeouts.Settings` instead.
- **Breaking**: Removed `RpcMode` type. Use `RuntimeInfo.IsServer` instead.
- **Breaking**: `ComputedRegistry.Instance` is gone, the whole class is now static
- **Breaking**: `Timeouts` and `IGenericTimeoutHandler` are moved to
  `ActualLab.Time` namespace.
- **Breaking**: reworked `OperationEvent` API enabling events with quantized delay.
  Such events have Uuid, which includes its DelayUntil value, and have quantized DelayUntil.
  So you can use them to implement reliable throttling for such activities as post-change
  indexing or AI processing
- **Breaking**: `IHasDelayUntil` interface is removed, and thus its support in
  `OperationEvent` handling logic.
- **Breaking**: .NET Framework 4.7.1 target is replaced with .NET Framework 4.7.2

### Added
- .NET 10 RC2 support
- `allowInconsistent` flag in `Computed/AnyState/ComputedSource.Use()` and
  `.UseUntyped()` methods. Get the value even if it's inconsistent; when called
  inside a compute method, instantly invalidates the newly created computed
  if an inconsistent dependency gets captured.
- `bool Operation.MustStore` property allowing to disable the operation log entry creation;
  this is useful when you're sure you don't need distributed invalidation for the current
  operation - e.g., you know that only the local machine is responsible for exposing modified data.
  When `MustStore` is `false`, a `DbEvent` (in `Processed` state) is created instead of 
  an `DbOperation` entry to verify commit in case of commit failure.
- `OperationScope.CompletionHandlers` allowing to register operation completion handler
  right inside the command handler
- `RpcCallRouteOverride` type allowing to override outgoing RPC call routing 
  (e.g., set destination peer)
- `Moment.Floor`, `Moment.Ceiling`, `Moment.Round`, and `Moment.Convert` methods;
  `Moment.Ceiling` is used to quantize delayed events.  

### Changed
- Moved command routing logic to `RpcRoutingCommandHandler`
- Renamed `ComputeServiceCommandCompletionInvalidator` to `InvalidatingCommandCompletionHandler`
- Improvements in `RetryPolicy` / `IRetryPolicy`, including exception filters
- `ArgumentListG*<...>` is now IL/AOT-trimmable via `ArgumentList.AllowGenerics` feature switch

### Fixed
- Native AOT support in .NET 10
- A bug in `ComputeRegistry` that could cause `ComputedRegistry` 
  to expose a wrong `Computed` due to a race between `ComputedRegistry.Get` 
  and `ComputedRegistry.Register`. If `Get` gets paused between a moment it
  read a handle and resolved its `Target`, the handle with the same `IntPtr` value 
  might get re-allocated.
  This is extremely rare, but nevertheless, we saw this happening in production.
- The identical bug in `RpcObjectTracker` (it's used to track `RpcStream`-s).
- `IDelegatingCommand` now "implements" `IOutermostCommand` (it was supposed to, but didn't)
- `StatefulComponent.StateChanged` handler now suppresses `ExecutionContext` flow
- Bug in `RpcSystemCallSender.Ok` breaking `RpcStream` serialization in call results
- Bug in `RpcStream` enumerator
- Proper framework version check in `CpuTimestamp` for .NET 10 WASM
- Removed `Microsoft.Extensions.Http` reference from `ActualLab.Rpc`

### Performance
- `WebSocketChannel.ReadMode` and corresponding option enabling unbuffered reads
  without use of `Reader` (which is backed by its own `Channel`).
  This option alone improves RPC performance by 5%.
- Use `CancellationToken.None` in `WebSocket` operations in `WebSocketChannel`
  without sacrificing cancellation support 
  (`WebSocket` is properly disconnected on cancellation now)
- `RpcStream` now uses `Memory<byte>` instead of `byte[]` for its buffer.
- Use of `Unsafe.As<T>(x)` instead of `(T)x` in a few key places.
- Improvements in key Fusion components, including 
  `ComputedRegistry`, `Computed`, and `ComputedState`, 
- Improvements in Blazor components, including 
  `StatefulComponentBase` and `ComputedStateComponentBase` 
- Improvements in infrastructure components, including 
  `ArgumentList`, `FixedArray`, `AsyncLock`, and `AsyncLockSet`.

### Infrastructure
- Added `WeakReferenceSlim` (currently unused)
- Added `TaskExt.NeverEnding(CancellationToken)` helper
- Added `FixedTimerSet` and `ConcurrentFixedTimerSet`
- Improved `CancellationTokenSource`-based timeout handling code across the board
- Improved tests.

### Documentation
- Added `.instructions.md` (like AGENTS.md) for agent rules
- Finalized Part01, added examples for `Computed<T>.When()` and `Changes()` methods.
