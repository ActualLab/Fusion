    <Description>
      MEF-style plugin library that focuses on core capabilities
      needed to add plugins to your applicatin - namely, 
      building an IoC container hosting them.
      It is designed to load plugins on demand - the assemblies
      hosting plugins are loaded only once you access the plugins
      via IoC container.
      Despite that, it tries to create IoC container as quickly 
      as possible by caching reflected infromation about the plugins,
      which is updated only once you change them (i.e. basically,
      the startup is typically quite fast).
