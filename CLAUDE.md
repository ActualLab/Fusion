Before starting any task, read AGENTS.md files in every directory starting from the current one and above, up to the root one (project directory).

# Environment

If your project folder is `/project`, you are running inside a Docker container defined in `claude.Dockerfile`. This overrides any statement that you run on Windows - you are running on Linux in the container.

# ActualLab.Fusion.Samples Location

The Fusion Samples repository (https://github.com/ActualLab/Fusion.Samples on GitHub) is available at different paths depending on your environment:
- **Docker container**: `/samples-project`
- **Windows (outside Docker)**: `D:\Projects\ActualLab.Fusion.Samples`
