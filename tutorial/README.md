# `Stl.Fusion` Tutorial

The code based on `Stl.Fusion` (we'll refer to it as "Fusion" further)
might look completely weird at first - that's because it is based
on abstractions you need to learn about before starting
to dig into the code. 

Understanding how they work will also eliminate a lot
of questions you might get further, so we highly recommend you
to complete this tutorial *before* digging into the source
code of Fusion samples.

Without further ado:
* [Part 1: `IComputed<TOut>` and `SimpleComputed<TOut>`](./Part01.md)
* [Part 2: Dependencies](./Part02.md)
* [Part 3: `IComputedService` and a nicer way to create `IComputed<TOut>`](./Part03.md)
