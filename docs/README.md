  a playlist with videos from the [Tutorial].
* [Modern Real-Time Apps With Fusion + Blazor: Intro + Samples Overview](https://youtu.be/jYVe5yd0xuQ)
  Sorry in advance: the video is long, it implies you already played with Blazor, 
  and finally, the commenter there clearly needs more practice :/ 
  On a bright side, likely it will still save you more time than 
  you'll spend on it.
  **Check out its description - there is TOC + links to interesting parts.**
* More videos are upcoming.
