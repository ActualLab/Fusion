## Documentation

* [Overview](Overview.md) is the best place to start. 
  It describes what Stl.Fusion is on conceptual level
  and explains the most tricky concepts on relatively simple
  examples.
* [Tutorial](https://github.com/servicetitan/Stl.Fusion.Samples/blob/master/docs/tutorial/README.md) &ndash; 
  now a part of [Stl.Fusion.Samples repository](https://github.com/servicetitan/Stl.Fusion.Samples),
  not fully finished yet, but the best part is: it is interactive, so any code you see
  there is runnable!
* [The Story Behind Stl.Fusion](Story.md) &ndash; maybe you'll find
  it interesting too.
* Join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/EKEwv6d) 
  to ask questions and track project updates
* Check out [Q/A](QA.md) to get answers on some frequent questions.

  so far the best description of what Fusion is for non-developers

That's it for now, but we'll definitely add more over time.

* The authors and maintainers of every library used by `Stl.Fusion`. Most notably,
  [DynamicProxy from Castle.Core](http://www.castleproject.org/projects/dynamicproxy/),
