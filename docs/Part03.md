# Part 3: Distributed Compute Services

Fusion is designed with distributed applications in mind,
and one of its key features is the ability to expose Compute Services
over the network via `ActualLab.Rpc` and consume such services
via Compute Service Clients.

## What is ActualLab.Rpc?

ActualLab.Rpc is a high-performance RPC framework for .NET that provides
a way to call methods on remote services as if they were local.
It uses **WebSockets** as low-level transport, but it's built to run on top of
nearly any packet-based or streaming protocol, so it will support
WebTransport in the near future.

It is designed to be fast, efficient, and extensible enough
to support Fusion's Remote Compute Service scenario.

## What is Compute Service Client?

Compute Service Clients are remote (client-side) proxies for Compute Services built on top of the ActualLab.Rpc
infrastructure. They take the behavior of `Computed<T>` into account to be significantly more
efficient than equivalent plain RPC clients:

1. **Consistent Behavior**: They back the result of any call with `Computed<T>` that mimics the matching `Computed<T>` on the server side. This means client-side proxies can be used in other client-side Compute Services, and invalidation of a server-side dependency will trigger invalidation of its client-side replica.

2. **Efficient Caching**: They cache consistent `Computed<T>` replicas, and they won't make a remote call when a _consistent_ replica is still available. This provides exactly the same behavior as Compute Services, replacing "computation" with an "RPC call responsible for the computation."

3. **Automatic Invalidation**: Client-side replicas of `Computed<T>` are automatically invalidated when their server-side counterparts get invalidated, ensuring eventual consistency across the network.

4. Resilience features like transparent reconnection on disconnect, persistent client-side caching, and ETag-style checks for every computed replica on reconnect are bundled &ndash; `ActualLab.Rpc` and `ActualLab.Fusion.Client` take care of that.

## Using ActualLab.Rpc to create Compute Service Client

Let's create a simple chat service that demonstrates how Compute Service Clients work.

### 1. Shared Service Interface

First, we define a common interface that both the server-side service
and client-side proxy will implement. It will allow us to use them interchangeably
in our code, so we can map the interface to:

- a compute service implementation on the server side (e.g., in Blazor Server)
- a compute service client on the client side (WASM, MAUI, etc.).

<!-- snippet: Part03_SharedApi -->
```cs
// The interface for our chat service
public interface IChatService : IComputeService
{
    // Compute methods – they cache the output not only on the server side
    // but on the client side as well!
    [ComputeMethod]
    Task<List<string>> GetRecentMessages(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    [ComputeMethod]
    Task<int> GetWordCount(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);

    // Regular methods
    Task Post(string message, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task<int> GetWordCountPlainRpc(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}
```
<!-- endSnippet -->

### 2. Server-Side Compute Service (Implementation)

Now let's implement the server-side compute service:

<!-- snippet: Part03_ServerImplementation -->
```cs
public class ChatService : IChatService
{
    private readonly Lock _lock = new();
    private List<string> _posts = new();

    // It's a [ComputeMethod] method -> it has to be virtual to allow Fusion to override it
    public virtual Task<List<string>> GetRecentMessages(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
        => Task.FromResult(_posts);

    // It's a [ComputeMethod] method -> it has to be virtual to allow Fusion to override it
    public virtual async Task<int> GetWordCount(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        // NOTE: GetRecentMessages() is a compute method, so the GetWordCount() call becomes dependent on it,
        // and that's why it gets invalidated automatically when GetRecentMessages() is invalidated.
        var messages = await GetRecentMessages(cancellationToken).ConfigureAwait(false);
        return messages
            .Select(m => m.Split(" ", StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries).Length)
            .Sum();
    }

    // Regular method
    public Task<int> GetWordCountPlainRpc(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
        => GetWordCount(cancellationToken);

    // Regular method
    public Task Post(string message, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        lock (_lock) {
            var posts = _posts.ToList(); // We can't update the list itself (it's shared), but we can re-create it
            posts.Add(message);
            if (posts.Count > 10)
                posts.RemoveAt(0);
            _posts = posts;
        }

        using var _1 = Invalidation.Begin();
        _ = GetRecentMessages(default); // No need to invalidate GetWordCount() – it depends on GetRecentMessages()
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```
<!-- endSnippet -->

### 3. Configuration

We'll use ASP.NET Core Web Host to host the ActualLab.Rpc server
that exposes `IChatService`:

<!-- snippet: Part03_ServerSetup -->
```cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder();
builder.Logging.ClearProviders().SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Debug).AddConsole();
builder.Services.Configure<HostOptions>(options => options.ShutdownTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3));

// Adding Fusion.
// RpcServiceMode.Server is going to be the default mode for further `fusion.AddService()` calls,
// which means that any compute service added via `fusion.AddService()` will be shared via RPC as well.
var fusion = builder.Services.AddFusion(RpcServiceMode.Server);
fusion.AddWebServer(); // Adds the RPC server middleware
fusion.AddService<IChatService, ChatService>(RpcServiceMode.Server); // Adds the chat service impl. (Compute Service)

var app = builder.Build();
app.UseWebSockets(); // Enable WebSockets support on Kestrel server
app.MapRpcWebSocketServer(); // Map the ActualLab.Rpc WebSocket server endpoint ("/rpc/ws")
```
<!-- endSnippet -->

<!-- snippet: Part03_RunServer -->
```cs
try {
    await app.RunAsync("http://localhost:22222/").WaitAsync(cancellationToken);
}
catch (Exception error) {
    if (error.IsCancellationOf(cancellationToken))
        await app.StopAsync();
    else
        Error.WriteLine($"Server failed: {error.Message}");
}
```
<!-- endSnippet -->

As for the client-side, we need to:

1. Configure `IServiceProvider` to use both Fusion and ActualLab.Rpc
2. Make Fusion to register Compute Service Client (in fact, an "advanced" RPC client) for `IChatService`.

<!-- snippet: Part03_ClientSetup -->
```cs
var fusion = services.AddFusion(); // No default RpcServiceMode, so it will be set to RpcServiceMode.Local
var rpc = fusion.Rpc; // The same as services.AddRpc(), but slightly faster, since FusionBuilder already did it
rpc.AddWebSocketClient("http://localhost:22222/"); // Adds the WebSocket client for ActualLab.Rpc
fusion.AddClient<IChatService>(); // Adds the chat service client (Compute Service Client)
```
<!-- endSnippet -->

### 4. Client Usage

API-wise, there is no difference between the Compute Service and its client.

But the similarity goes even further: it serves the replicas of server-side computed
values under the hood, so it also behaves the same. In particular:

- `Computed.Capture(...)` and `Computed<T>.Changes()` work the same way with the client
- If your client hosts local Compute Services, the computed values they
  produce can be dependent on computed values produced by Compute Service Client.

In other words, there is no difference between the Compute Service and its client.
And that's what makes Compute Services so powerful: they allow building reactive
services that can be local, remote, or even a mix of both (later you'll learn that
Fusion also supports distributed call routing and service meshes), and no matter
which kind of service you use, they behave the same way.

And finally, this is what powers the client-side reactivity in all Fusion + Blazor samples.

Fusion's `ComputedStateComponent<T>` uses `ComputedState<T>` under the hood,
so when such states get (re)computed, their outputs become dependent on
the output of Compute Service Client(s) they call, which, in turn, "mirror"
the server-side Compute Service outputs. So:

- when the corresponding server-side `Computed<T>` gets invalidated,
- ActualLab.Rpc call tracker subscribed to it sends ~ `Invalidate(callId)` message to the client,
- which invalidates the client-side `Computed<T>` replica of that server-side computed value,
- which triggers the invalidation of the client-side `Computed<T>` values depending on it,
- some of such computed instances are associated with `ComputedStateComponent<T>.State`-s,
- which triggers re-computation of these states,
- which, in turn, triggers re-rendering of corresponding `ComputedStateComponent<T>`-s.

<!-- snippet: Part03_RunClient -->
```cs
await using var services = CreateClientServiceProvider();
var chatClient = services.GetRequiredService<IChatService>();

// Start GetWordCount() change observer
var cWordCount0 = await Computed.Capture(() => chatClient.GetWordCount());
_ = Task.Run(async () => {
    await foreach (var cWordCount in cWordCount0.Changes())
        WriteLine($"GetWordCount() -> {cWordCount}, Value: {cWordCount.Value}");
});

// Start GetRecentMessages() change observer
var cMessages0 = await Computed.Capture(() => chatClient.GetRecentMessages());
_ = Task.Run(async () => {
    await foreach (var cMessages in cMessages0.Changes()) {
        await Task.Delay(25); // We delay the output to print GetWordCount() first
        WriteLine($"GetRecentMessages() -> {cMessages}, Value:");
        foreach (var message in cMessages.Value)
            WriteLine($"- {message}");
        WriteLine();
    }
});

// Post some messages
await chatClient.Post("Hello, World!");
await Task.Delay(100);
await chatClient.Post("Let's count to 3!");
string[] data = ["One", "Two", "Three"];
for (var i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    await Task.Delay(1000);
    await chatClient.Post(data.Take(i).ToDelimitedString());
}
await Task.Delay(1000);
await chatClient.Post("Done counting!");
await Task.Delay(1000);
```
<!-- endSnippet -->

The output:

## Client Performance

Computed Service Clients are invalidation-aware, which means they also eliminate unnecessary RPC calls.
The RPC call is deemed unnecessary, if:

- The client finds a `Computed<T>` replica for it (i.e., for the same call to the same service with the same arguments)
- And this replica is still in `Consistent` state (i.e., wasn't invalidated from the moment it was created).

In other words, Computed Service Clients cache call results and reuse them
until they learn from the server that some of these results have been invalidated.

And that's why performance-wise, such clients are almost exact replicas of server-side Compute Services:

- They resort to RPC only when they don't have a cached value for a given call,
  or a re-computation (due to invalidation) happened on the server side
- Otherwise, they respond instantly.

Let's see this in action. We've already added the `GetWordCountPlainRpc` method to our interface
and implementation &ndash; since it's not a compute method, it won't benefit from Fusion's caching.

<!-- snippet: Part03_Benchmark -->
```cs
// Benchmarking remote compute method calls and plain RPC calls – run in Release mode!
WriteLine("100K calls to GetWordCount() vs GetWordCountPlainRpc():");
WriteLine("- Warmup...");
for (int i = 0; i < 100_000; i++)
    await chatClient.GetWordCount().ConfigureAwait(false);
for (int i = 0; i < 100_000; i++)
    await chatClient.GetWordCountPlainRpc().ConfigureAwait(false);
WriteLine("- Benchmarking...");
var stopwatch = Stopwatch.StartNew();
for (int i = 0; i < 100_000; i++)
    await chatClient.GetWordCount().ConfigureAwait(false);
WriteLine($"- GetWordCount():         {stopwatch.Elapsed.ToShortString()}");
stopwatch.Restart();
for (int i = 0; i < 100_000; i++)
    await chatClient.GetWordCountPlainRpc().ConfigureAwait(false);
WriteLine($"- GetWordCountPlainRpc(): {stopwatch.Elapsed.ToShortString()}");
```
<!-- endSnippet -->

The output:

<!-- snippet: Part03_Benchmark_Output -->
```cs
/* The output:
100K calls to GetWordCount() vs GetWordCountPlainRpc() – run in Release mode!
- Warmup...
- Benchmarking...
- GetWordCount():         12.187ms
- GetWordCountPlainRpc(): 2.474s
*/
```
<!-- endSnippet -->

As you can see, Compute Service Client processes about **10,000,000 calls/s**
on a single CPU core in the "cache hit" scenario.

A bit more robust test would produce 18M call/s, or 55ns per-call timing on the same machine;
for the comparison, a single `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` lookup requires ~5-10ns on .NET 10.

And it's ~200x faster than plain RPC via ActualLab.Rpc, which translates to **600-2000x
speedup compared to RPC via SignalR, gRPC, or HTTP**.

If you are interested in more robust benchmarks, check out `Benchmark` and `RpcBenchmark`
projects in [Fusion Samples](https://github.com/ActualLab/Fusion.Samples).

## Client-Side Computed State

In [Part 1](./Part01.md), you learned about `ComputedState<T>` &ndash; a state that
auto-updates once it becomes inconsistent. Now, let's show that client-side
`ComputedState<T>` can use a Compute Service Client to "observe" the output of
a server-side Compute Service.

The code below reuses the `IChatService` and server setup from above,
but adds a `ComputedState<T>` on the client side that tracks changes:

<!-- snippet: Part03_ClientComputedState -->
```cs
var stateFactory = services.StateFactory();
using var state = stateFactory.NewComputed(
    new ComputedState<string>.Options() {
        UpdateDelayer = FixedDelayer.Get(0.5), // 0.5 second update delay
        EventConfigurator = state1 => {
            // A shortcut to attach 3 event handlers: Invalidated, Updating, Updated
            state1.AddEventHandler(StateEventKind.All,
                (s, e) => WriteLine($"{e}: {s.Value}"));
        },
    },
    async (state, cancellationToken) => {
        var wordCount = await chatClient.GetWordCount(cancellationToken);
        return $"Word count: {wordCount}";
    });

await state.Update(); // Ensures the state gets an up-to-date value

await chatClient.Post("Hello, World!");
await Task.Delay(1000);
await chatClient.Post("One Two Three");
await Task.Delay(1000);
```
<!-- endSnippet -->

The output:

```text
Invalidated:
Updating:
Updated: Word count: 0
Invalidated: Word count: 0
Updating: Word count: 0
Updated: Word count: 2
Invalidated: Word count: 2
Updating: Word count: 2
Updated: Word count: 5
```

Notice the state lifecycle:
1. **Updated** &ndash; state was computed (or re-computed)
2. **Invalidated** &ndash; the state's underlying `Computed<T>` became inconsistent
3. **Updating** &ndash; state is about to recompute (after the `UpdateDelayer` delay)

This is exactly the mechanism that powers real-time UI in Fusion's Blazor components.

## Real-Time UI Updates

As you might guess, this is exactly the logic our Blazor samples use to update
the UI in real time. Moreover, we similarly use the same interface both for
Compute Services and their clients &ndash; and that's precisely what allows
us to have the same UI components working in WASM and Server-Side Blazor mode:

- When UI components are rendered on the server side, they pick server-side
  Compute Services from host's `IServiceProvider` as implementation of
  `IWhateverService`. Replicas aren't needed there, because everything is local.
- And when the same UI components are rendered on the client, they pick
  Compute Service Client as `IWhateverService` from the client-side IoC container,
  and that's what makes any `IState<T>` update in real time there, which
  in turn makes UI components re-render.

## Summary

**That's pretty much it &ndash; now you've learned all the key features of Fusion.**
There are details, of course, and the rest of the tutorial is mostly about them.
