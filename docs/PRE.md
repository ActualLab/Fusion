Before you proceed further, you ABSOLUTELY need to read the following files:
- `/Docs/README.md`
- `/README.md`
- `/Docs/AGENTS.md`
- `/AGENTS.md`

Now, we are going to migrate the old Fusion documentation located in `Docs/tutorial/` folder into the new `Part*.md` and `Part*.cs` files in `Docs/` folder.

Our goal is to make it better - easier to read, cleaner, and factually correct (based on the most current source code version).

You'll be getting more detailed instructions on what exactly has to be done further. To learn what these instructions imply, consider that `Docs/Part01.*` files were generated as a request to merge and update `Part01.md`-`Part03.md` from the old Fusion documentation in `Docs/tutorial` folder. SEE THESE FILES before starting your actual task.
