Before you proceed further, you ABSOLUTELY need to read the following files:
- `README.md` (located in `docs/` folder)
- `../README.md` (located in the root folder)
- `.instructions.md`
- `../.instructions.md`

Currently, we are migrating the old Fusion documentation located 
in `docs/tutorial/` folder into the new `Part*.md` and `Part*.cs` 
files in `docs/` folder.

Our goal is to make it better: easier to read, cleaner, and factually correct -
based on the most current source code version.

You'll be getting more detailed instructions on what exactly has to be done further. 

To learn what these instructions imply, consider that `docs/Part01.*` files were generated 
as a request to merge and update `Part01.md`-`Part03.md` from the old Fusion documentation 
in `docs/tutorial` folder. SEE THESE FILES before starting your actual task.
