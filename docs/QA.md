## 5. Q/A

> Q: Can I contribute to the project?

Absolutely - just create your first 
[pull request](https://github.com/servicetitan/Stl/pulls) or 
[report a bug](https://github.com/servicetitan/Stl/issues).

> Q: Does ServiceTitan use Stl.Fusion now?

Yes, but not in production. We're currently using it on our internal DevPortal web site, 
which aggregates the information about all of our Kubernetes-based app instances.
The intent is to turn DevPortal into a "home page" for all of our developers, 
so it will aggregate much more useful information over time.

This is actually pretty good, taking into account the following timeline:
* End of March 2020: first lines of Stl.Fusion code were written
* Late May 2020: "Server Time" sample was added, i.e. Fusion got its 
  distributed state replication working
* Mid-June 2020: We actually started to use it on DevPortal
* July 6, 2020: This line was written :)    
  
> Q: What's the best place to ask questions related to Stl.Fusion?

[Stl.Fusion Discord Server](https://discord.gg/EKEwv6d) is currently the best 
place to ask questions & track project updates. 

> Q: What "Stl" stands for?

It's an acronym for "ServiceTitan Library".
