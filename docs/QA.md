## Possible use cases, pros and cons

> Q: Can I use Fusion with server-side Blazor?

Yes, you can use it to implement the same real-time update logic there. 
The only difference here is that you don't need API controllers supporting
Fusion publication in this case, i.e. your models might depend right on the 
*server-side compute services* (that's an abstraction you primarily deal with, 
that "hides" all the complexities of dealing with `IComputed` 
and does it transparently for you).

> Q: Can I use Fusion *without* Blazor at all?

The answer is yes &ndash; you can use Fusion in all kinds of .NET Core 
apps, though I guess the real question is:

> Q: Can I use Fusion with some native JavaScript client for it?

Right now there is no native JavaScript client for Fusion, so if you
want to use Fusion subscriptions / auto-update features in JS,
you still need a counterpart in Blazor that e.g. exports the "live state" 
maintained by Fusion to the JavaScript part of the app after every update.

There is a good chance we (or someone else) will develop a native 
JavaScript client for Fusion in future.

> Q: Are there any benefits of using Fusion on server-side only?

Yes. Any service backed by Fusion, in fact, gets a cache, that invalidates 
right when it should. This makes % of inconsistent reads there is as small
as possible. 

Which is why Fusion is also a very good fit for caching scenarios requiring
nearly real-time invalidation / minimum % of inconsistent reads.
