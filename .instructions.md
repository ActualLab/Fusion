# Build and test instructions for ActualLab.Fusion (Fusion) repository

## Scope

This file applies to the entire repository: all code, documentation, 
and scripts under this directory tree.

IMPORTANT: Read `README.md` to learn what Fusion is.

## Technology Stack

- **Language and Platform**: by default, the project is compiled with .NET 9 (and C# 13), but all the code in `/src` folder is ready to target .NET Standard 2.0 and above, .NET Core 3.1 and above, and .NET Framework 4.7 and above. `-p:UseMultitargeting=true` enables this multi-targeting mode.
- **Databases**: some parts of Fusion use Entity Framework Core; the tests are using Sqlite, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, and Microsoft SQL Server containers to verify that.
- **Other technologies**: projects with `Blazor` in their name (e.g., )`ActualLab.Fusion.Blazor`) use Blazor.
- **Testing**: all tests are based on xUnit.
- **Documentation**: see `docs/.instructions.md`.

## Project Structure

- Main solution: `ActualLab.Fusion.sln`
- Files are organized as:
  - `src/` contains Fusion's source code
  - `samples/` folder contains sample projects
  - `docs/` folder contains the documentation - a set of `Part*.md` files. The source code snippets there are updated from corresponding `Part*.cs` files using `dotnet mdsnippets` tool. The documentation is a work-in-progress at this point.
  - `tests/` folder contain two test projects: `ActualLab.Tests` (all tests except Fusion-related ones) and `ActualLab.Fusion.Tests` (Fusion-related tests).
  - `build/` folder contains Bullseye-based `Build.csproj` - a project responsible for a set of advanced build tasks (e.g., building NuGet packages).

## Build Prerequisites

- Install .NET 9
- Run:
  ```powershell
  dotnet restore
  dotnet tool restore
  ```
- And if you're going to build the documentation:
  ```powershell
  cd Docs
  npm -i
  ```

## Building

The most important files related to build process are:
- `*.sln` and `*.csproj` files
- `Directory.Build.props` (also located in some of sub-folders) and `Directory.Build.targets` files
- `Directory.Packages.props` file listing versions of C# project dependencies.
- You can also look at `.github/workflows/Build.yml` and `.config/dotnet-tools.json`.

- To build the main solution, use:
  ```powershell
  dotnet build ActualLab.Fusion.sln
  ```

- To verify the syntax of code snippets used in the documentation:
  ```powershell
  dotnet build docs/Docs.csproj
  ```

- Do build the documentation:
  ```powershell
  cd Docs
  dotnet build Docs.csproj
  dotnet mdsnippets
  call npm run docs:build
  ```

- You can build individual projects by specifying their `.csproj` file:
  ```powershell
  dotnet build path/to/project.csproj
  ```

## Testing

Tests are located under `tests/`.

- To run all tests:
  ```powershell
  docker compose up -d redis postgres sqlserver mariadb
  dotnet test ActualLab.Fusion.sln
  ```
- To run a specific .csproj with xUnit tests:
  ```powershell
  dotnet test tests/<TestProjectName>/<TestProjectName>.csproj
  ```

## Coding Conventions
- Follow .NET and C# best practices for code style and structure, BUT if you see a different convention is used in the existing source code, stick to it.
- Organize code into appropriate folders: `src/` for main libraries, `samples/` for sample apps, `tests/` for test projects, `docs/` for documentation.
- Use clear, descriptive names for classes, methods, and variables.
- DON'T write XML documentation comments for public APIs UNLESS they are already there.

## Pull Request Messages
- When creating a PR, include a brief summary of changes with a standard feat/fix/refactor/chore/docs prefix.
- Reference related issues or discussions if applicable.

## Programmatic Checks
- After making changes, run at least `dotnet build ActualLab.Fusion.sln` to verify they at least don't break the build.
- Ensure all builds pass before submitting changes.
